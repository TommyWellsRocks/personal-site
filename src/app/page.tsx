            I&apos;ve been blessed with an unconventional journey. Instead of
            college, I went to work in entrepreneurship from{" "}
            <TextLink href="/about#desirem">e-commerce</TextLink> all the way to{" "}
            <TextLink href="/about#buffdup">concrete coatings</TextLink>. I
            learned priceless lessons on resilience, lifelong learning, and the
            power of loving the process.

            <TextLink href="/about#learning">From the start of 2024</TextLink>,
            I started and fell in love with coding. After trying to code a web
            app with python ðŸ¤£, I then learned Javascript, Typescript, React,
            and recently, Go.

            I love working on frontend and backend. Building, optimizing, and
            simplifying is my obsession. Figuring out ways to make life simpler
            AND more efficient... that, really, really gets me excited.

            you&apos;ll find me at the gym, watching movies, or jamming to the
            Bee Gees on a sunday drive.
